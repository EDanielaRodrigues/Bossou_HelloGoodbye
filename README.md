# Bossou_HelloGoodbye
Communication during fissions and fusions by chimpanzees of the Bossou community, Guinea

In humans’ fission-fusion societies, ritualized non-linguistic signal exchanges that include gestures, vocalizations, and
facial expressions are regularly observed at both arrivals (greetings) and departures (leave-takings). These communicative
events play an important role in the formation and maintenance of social relationships. Wild chimpanzees also form large
communities that split into smaller fluid parties during daily activities, with individuals moving freely between them.
However, in chimpanzees only greetings have been reported. This study explores signal exchanges in the Bossou chimpanzee
community during fissions (departures) and fusions (arrivals) given an individual’s social rank, kinship, position as
traveller or party member, the level of potential threat, and the party size and presence of mature males. We analysed three
time periods (1993-1994; 2003-2004; 2013-2014) during which the composition and social hierarchy of the community varied. We
show that the occurrence and form of communication during fission and fusion events are mediated by social factors,
including rank, kinship, and party size and composition. Individuals were more likely to communicate during fusions than
during fissions, communication was more likely to be produced towards a higher ranking individual and to non-kin
individuals, but high-ranking individuals were also more likely to communicate. The presence of more individuals, and in
particular mature males, decreased the likelihood of communication. Communication during fusions supported patterns reported
in previous studies on greetings; and our results support the argument that, if present, leave-takings are not a common
feature of chimpanzee social interactions. Current methodological difficulties regarding the function of declarative signals
hinder our ability to discriminate potential parting rituals within communication before departures and should provide a
note of caution in the interpretation of all signals produced during fusions as ‘greetings’.
